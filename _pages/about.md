My objective for studies in Computer Science is to prepare myself for the long-term goal of pursuing a career in research. I have nurtured a strong passion for becoming a scientist and for pursuing research. As such, I have always nurtured this passion by adopting a rigorous approach in order to have an in-depth understanding of the problem at hand. This is amply reflected in my consistently strong academic background, always topping the class.
