My objective for studies in Computer Science is to prepare myself for the long-term goal of pursuing a career in research. I have nurtured a strong passion for becoming a scientist and for pursuing research. As such, I have always nurtured this passion by adopting a rigorous approach in order to have an in-depth understanding of the problem at hand. This is amply reflected in my consistently strong academic background, always topping the class.

I have passed my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Kashmir-North Campus—I am the topper of my batch. My Master’s degree has provided me with a strong and comprehensive background in Computer Science. The curriculum included all the basic courses such as Computer Networks and Security, Wireless and Mobile Communication, Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Structures, Computer Organization and Design, Systems Programming, Theory of Computation, Java Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks etc.

I have enjoyed being able to apply what I learned so far. I believe that creativity in research and development comes from the persevering effort driven by the will to create something new and better. It is this creative will that I wish to pursue as a researcher in academia. Through my research, I expect to become, and will work hard to be, an effective researcher and teacher.
